<!-- 
This is a raw HTML form created by hand using the CSS classes provided by Bootstrap 4. 

In the <form> tag, we have to define the method attribute. This instructs the browser on how we want to communicate with the server.

GET is perhaps the most common request type. It’s used to retrieve data from the server. Every time you click on a link or type a URL directly into the browser, you are creating a GET request.

POST is used when we want to change data on the server. So, generally speaking, every time we send data to the server that will result in a change in the state of a resource, we should always send it via POST request.

Django protects all POST requests using a CSRF Token (Cross-Site Request Forgery Token). It’s a security measure to avoid external sites or applications to submit data to our application. Every time the application receives a POST, it will first look for the CSRF Token. If the request has no token, or the token is invalid, it will discard the posted data.
